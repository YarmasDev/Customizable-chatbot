# Customizable Chatbot

This project utilizes Streamlit and Groq to create a customizable chatbot that adapts its responses based on user-defined characteristics. Users can specify how they want their chatbot to behave and engage in conversations for personalized interactions.

## Features

- **Customizable Personality**: Describe your chatbot's characteristics to tailor its responses to your preferences.
- **Real-Time Conversation**: Engage in dynamic conversations with the chatbot, which learns from the context.
- **Model Used**: This chatbot leverages the `Llama3` model for generating responses, ensuring high-quality and contextually relevant answers.
